## How to migrate existing data to match your Prisma schema

Migrating your database over time is an important part of the development cycle. During development, you will need to update your Prisma schema file (for example, to add new fields), then update the data in your development environmentâ€™s database, and eventually push both the updated schema and the new data to the production database.

## Referrence here 
https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/mongodb#how-to-migrate-existing-data-to-match-your-prisma-schema


## After adding a new Field on Schema 

```bash
model User {
  id    String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  email String
}
```

if you want to add new field like below make it option or give it default value

```bash

model User {
  id          String  @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  email       String
  phoneNumber String?
}
```

giving it default value like below 

Then regenerate your Prisma Client using the npx prisma generate command. Next, update your application to reflect the new field, and redeploy your app.

<p>As the phoneNumber field is optional, you can still query the old users where the phone number has not been defined. The records in the database will be updated "on demand" as the application's users begin to enter their phone number in the new field.</p>

Another option is to add a default value on a required field, for example

```bash
model User {
  id          String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  email       String
  phoneNumber String @default("000-000-0000")
}
```

Then when you encounter a missing phoneNumber, the value will be coerced into 000-000-0000.
